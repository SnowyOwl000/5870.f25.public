Given an array $A$ of elements that come from a total order, an \emph{inversion}
in $A$ is a pair of elements that are in the wrong order, that is, a pair
$(i,j)$ where $i<j$ and $A[i]>A[j]$. Show that the in-place version of insertion
sort, as given in Algorithm~5.5, runs in $O(n+I)$ time, where $I$ is the number
of inversions in the array $A$.\\[12pt]
